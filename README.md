# wf-control

Nextflow workflow for keeping a log to monitor a multispecies positive control over multiple sequencing runs.

The workflow is based on the [epi2me-labs/wf-template](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-template) v.5.3.0 from Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

<!---This section of documentation typically contains a list of things the workflow can perform also any other intro.--->

This workflow can be used for the following:

+ Combine [Emu](https://github.com/treangenlab/emu) output files from multiple sequencing runs.
+ Generate a html report with PCA plots using the R package [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html).
